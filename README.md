# rusty-chess-engine

Silly me trying to learn **Rust** and how to write a **chess engine** at the same time.

### **About**

This repo is for didactic purposes only, the main goal is to create a fully functioning chess engine in the future (stronger than any human GMs).

**This repo is not going to accept any contributions, until it's fully functioning.**
